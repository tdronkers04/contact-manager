<h1>Contact Manager</h1>

## Overview

 I created this project to reinforce topics I've recently, namely Async JavaScript, Event Listeners and manipulation of the DOM. Uers can perform CRUD operations via an API provided by a node back-end. Additionally, users can search for contacts by name or by #tag. I follwed the Model-View-Controller design pattern for the front-end code.

## Tech

This front-end focused project was built with HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and Handlebars client-side templating.

## Installation

- Navigate to a new folder in your terminal and execute the following command (SSH):

  `git clone git@github.com:tdronkers04/contact-manager.git`

- Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`

## How to Use

- Run `npm start` to start the server. You should see *listening on port 3000 of localhost...* in your logs

- navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
